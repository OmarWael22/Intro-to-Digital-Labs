# Intro-to-Digital-Labs

This repository contains code for two labs: BER Computing and Sampling.

## Labs 

1. BER Computing

This lab includes code to generate samples, generate bits, and decode bits from samples. It also includes a script to compute the bit error rate (BER) for a given set of samples.

2. Sampling

This lab includes code to construct oversampling, minimum and under-sampling, and uniform and non-uniform quantization.
